# Scorepochs - Gui

This project aims to create a GUI (Graphical User Iterface) for the Scorepochs tool already created in another work by Simone Maurizio La Cava.

Scorepochs aims to represent a simple tool for automatic scoring of resting-state M/EEG epochs to provide an accurate yet objective method to aid M/EEG experts during epoch selection procedure.

This graphical interface allows the user to implement the Scorepochs algorithm and obtain a graphical representation of the results, in such a way as to facilitate the choice.
